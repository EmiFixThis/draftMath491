\section{Introduction}



This paper contains a up-to-date, survey of lattice-based cryptography with an introduction to some information theoretic and security related topics. This survey begins at a high-level attempting to cover the minimal amount of terminology and background an undergraduate may need in order to start investigation into information theoretic and cryptographic fields; however, it is far from exhaustive, for a complete \footnote{but according to the author, Micciancio in some respects dated.}, field level and more exhaustive surveys I highly recommend \cite{Mic2002} by Micciancio, and the most recent field level survey \cite{Pei2015}. Both are quite dense, but more than worth the read.

This information is given in a format suitable for mathematics undergraduates who might wish to pursue such interests after graduation, or perhaps during an RUE. Movement proceeds towards results stemming from an incident in ideal ring-based fully homomorphic encryption called `Soliloquy'. Soliloquy was a ring-based primitive constructed by the \acrfull{gchq}, which subsequently turned into a classical, and quantum attack on a particular subset of lattice-based schemes constructed over the much abused cyclotomic field of characteristic two. 

 
The first sections give a brief introduction to classical cryptographic terminology and develops the concept of information theoretic security. The second section
