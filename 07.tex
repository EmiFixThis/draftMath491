The following table shows a few examples of cryptosystems which can be solved using Shor's algorithm, we refer to them as quantum unsafe, likewise if a problem seems to provide some degree of security against attack by a general purpose quantum computer we refer to it as \emph{quantum safe}.


Any sufficiently large general purpose quantum computer can `easily' solve the mathematical problems below using Shor's or another quantum algorithm.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}


Grover’s algorithm is a probabilistic quantum search algorithm which is able to find the unique input of a\gls{black box} function $f$, which maps to a unique output in $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})$ calculations, 
where $N = |Dom(f)|$. 
It was shown to be optimal by \cite{Ben1997}, with only $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})$ minimal number of evaluations required to find a solution. Despite that Grover’s is a probabilistic algorithm the number of evaluations expected before a solution is found is constant and not dependent upon $N$. 

Grover's only speeds up the computation of a black box function only quadratically. For large enough domains, $N$ is fast enough to allow brute force solutions of 128 bit symmetric keys in approximately $2^{64}$ calculations, 256 bit in $2^{128}$. 

Since Grover’s is a search algorithm (usually defined for databases) it is possible to consider the input and output values of $f$ as corresponding database entries and `search’ for one or more $x$ values to satisfy a given $y$ value. That is, we can think of Grover’s as performing an inversion on $y=f(x)$ and returning the correct $x$.
