\section{Lattice-based Cryptography (LBC)} 

Lattice-based cryptosystems are a subset of Post-quantum cryptographic schemes based over integer and algebraic lattices. 

 In nearly every \emph{classical} cryptographic construction of primitives proceeds as follows:


\begin{description}
    Generate a specific instance of a problem and it's solution in the complexity class $\mathbf{NP}$ such that it is reasonable to conclude the problem is `hard to solve' for some reason; where `hard to solve' is meant in the worst-case.
\end{description}


In 1996 Ajtai described the first average to worst-case hardness connections.
