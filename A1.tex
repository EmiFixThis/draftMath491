\section*{Appendix A: Gauss' Circle Problem}

Given a circle $\mathcal{R}^{2}$ with radius $r \geq 0$ centered at the origin $\mathcal{O}$, how many integer lattice points $(m,n)$ can you find in the circle?

Since we can express a circle in terms of Euclidean coordinates as:

[x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}.]

We can state the question in terms of our lattice points $(m,n)$ as:

[m^{2} + n^{2} \leq r^{2}.]

\subsection*{Approximate Solution}

The area of the inside of a circle is approximately $A \approx \pi r^{2}$.

Which gives us approximate solution in terms of $r$ for Gauss' circle problem (denoted $N(r)$) of:

[N(r) = \pi r^{2} + E(r),]
where $E(r)$ is some error term given by the radius.


\subsection*{Exact Solutions}

Two forms for an exact solution for the circle problem can be given in terms of sums. 

The first is a bit uglier:
[N(r) = 1 + 4 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left( \rfloor \frac{r^{2}}{4i+1} \lfloor - \rfloor \frac{r^{2}}{4i+3} \right).]

The second solution has a much nicer form if the sum of squares is defined as the number of ways of writing $n$ as the sum of two squares:

[N(r) = \sum_{n=0}^{r^{2}} r_{2}(n).]
