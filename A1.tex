\section{Appendix A: Gauss' Circle Problem}

\begin{que}
Given a circle $\mathcal{R}^{2}$ with radius $r \geq 0$ centered at the origin $\mathcal{O}$, how many integer lattice points $(m,n)$ can you find in the circle?
\end{que}

Since we can express a circle in terms of Euclidean coordinates as:

\[x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}.\]

We can state the question in terms of our lattice points $(m,n)$ as:

\[m^{2} + n^{2} \leq r^{2}.\]

\subsection*{Approximate Solution}

The area of the inside of a circle is approximately $A \approx \pi r^{2}$.

Which gives us an approximate solution in terms of $r$ for Gauss' circle problem (denoted $N(r)$) of:

\[N(r) = \pi r^{2} + E(r),\]
where $E(r)$ is some error term given by the radius.


\subsection*{Exact Solutions}

Two forms for an exact solution for the circle problem can be given in terms of sums. 

The first is a bit ugly:
\begin{sol}
    \[N(r) = 1 + 4 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \left( \bigg \lfloor \frac{r^{2}}{4i+1} \bigg \rfloor - \bigg \lfloor \frac{r^{2}}{4i+3} \bigg \rfloor \right)\]
\end{sol}

The second solution has a much nicer form if the sum of squares is defined as the number of ways of writing $n$ as the sum of two squares:

\begin{sol}
\[N(r) = \sum_{n=0}^{r^{2}} r_{2}(n)\]
\end{sol}
