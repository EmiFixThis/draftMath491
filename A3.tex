\section{Appendix C: Considerations When Choosing a Cryptosystem Replacement}

There are two main considerations for choosing a particular replacement scheme. 

The first is the environment which will be used to transmit the keys.  
Not all environments are suited to the same types of schemes.

Keys which will be transmitted over open network environments are better served by public key schemes. 
These schemes also allow parties who have never met before or who have never shared keys to communicate securely over open networks such as the Internet.  
Symmetric keys are the oldest type of encryption, characterized by private keys shared between parties which must be kept secret. 
Symmetric key need for secrecy makes these schemes inherently ill-suited for open network environments. 

The other consideration is a concept called Perfect Forward Secrecy.

Schemes enabled with Perfect Forward Secrecy come with the assurance that if one message is compromised it will not lead to other messages also being compromised.
