\section*{Appendix F: NC (Nik's Class) Complexity}

\textbf{NC} (Nick's Class) is the set of decision problems parallelized over a polynomial number of processors which are decidable in polylog time. That is, the set of problems which are efficiently solved by parallel computers. 

An equivalent (and at a general level somewhat more relevant) definition to the parallel processor definition of NC, is for the class defined in terms of Boolean circuits. 

For the Boolean statement, NC is the set of decision problems that can be calculated from the length of the given input (solved by uniform Boolean circuits) over a polynomial number of logic gates with at most two inputs, where the circuit depth is polylog $\mathcal{O}(\log^{i}{n}$.
