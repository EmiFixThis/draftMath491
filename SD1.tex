\section{Quantum Screws Up\footnote{Makes crypto even more interesting!} Classical Cryptography} 


The question of if a quantum computer could prove to be more powerful than a classical one was first proposed by Richard Feynmann in 1982. Feynmann first wondered if quantum mechanics might provide a more power computing device than a classical device based on binary type bits. He followed then asked the converse of his first question in an implicit form in 1986: "By using quantum mechanics can you compute more efficiently than on a classical computer?" Feynmann, proceeded to formally define quantum Turing machines and quantum bits in order to investigate these questions further.
