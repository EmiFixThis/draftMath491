\section{Post-quantum cryptography} 
The need for new cryptographic systems developed after Peter Shorr proved that the classical number-theoretic schemes could be easily broken by quantum computers. Quantum systems are capable of running algorithms which provide solutions to the mathematical problems the classical schemes base their security reductions on. The development of quantum computing lead to a new area of cryptography called post-quantum cryptography. 
 
Post-quantum cryptography is necessarily distinct from quantum cryptography it's concern is finding and implementing schemes which are secure against quantum-based attacks.
 
Not to be confused with Quantum-cryptography which uses quantum computers to find and implement new quantum cryptosystems.
