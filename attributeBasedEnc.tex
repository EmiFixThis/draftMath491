    name={attribute-based encryption},
    description={Attribute-based encryption is a public-key encryption scheme where a user's secret key and corresponding ciphertext are dependent upon some property held by the user. That is the key may be based on location, subscription, IP-address, etc. 
    Attribute-based encryption attempts to satisfy the conditions of 'collusion resistance', a security definition which states an adversary in possesion of multiple keys can only decrypt if at least one key permits access.
