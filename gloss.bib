@gd{unimod1,
    word={Unimodular Lattice},
    definition={An integral lattice which has determinant value 1 or (-1).},
    heading={U}
}

@gd{unimod2,
    word={Unimodular Lattice Equivalency},
    definition={In n-dimensional Euclidean space, the value of the determinant requires the fundamental domain of the lattice has a volume equal to one.},
    heading={U}
}

@gd{unimod3,
    word={Unimodular Lattice Example 1},
    definition={One example of a unimodular lattice is the E8 lattice.},
    heading={U}
}

@gd{unimod4,
    word={Unimodular Lattice Example 2},
    definition={Another example of a unimodular lattice is the Leech lattice.},

@gd{automorph,
    word={Automorphism},
    definition={In general, an automorphism is transformation of some system of objects onto itself. It must be noted that this definition has different meanings depending on the context.},
    heading={A}
}

@gd{code,
    word={codes},
    definition={Codes operate semantically on strings such as words, phrases, or sentences. For example, a code word or phrase could be anything such as “open sesame” or "the chairman's name is Bob" both having the same meaning "allow this person entry" if the word or phrase matches the one given to the doorman.},

}

@gd{cipher,
    word={cipher},
    definition={A cipher is a syntactic operation on letters or groups of letters. An example of this is a Cesar cipher such as $A \rightarrow F$, $B \rightarrow G$.},
    heading={C}
}

@gd{kra,
    word={Key Recovery Attack},
    definition={Attacks that lead to key recovery.},
    heading={K}
}

@gd{feas,
    word={feasible set},
    definition={the set of all possible points (sets of values of the choice variables) of an optimization problem that satisfy the problem's constraints, potentially including inequalities, equalities, and integer constraints.},
    heading={F}
}

@gd{gapsvpb1,
    word={GapSVP-$\beta$ 1},
    definition={$GapSVP_{\beta}$ is a \emph{promise problem} which differentiates between the instances of SVP where the answer is at most 1 or larger than $\beta$, where $\beta$ is allowed to be a fixed function of $f(n)$, such that $n$ is the number of vectors.},
    heading={G}
}

@gd{gapsvpb2,
    word={GapSVP-$\beta$ 2},
    definition={Given a basis $b$ for a lattice $\Lambda$, the $GapSVP-{\beta}$ decides if $\Lambda(b) \leq 1$ or $\Lambda{b} > \beta$, in all other cases the algorithm returns an error.}
    heading={G}
}

@gd{gapcvpb,
    word={$GapCVP_{\beta}$},
    definition={The $Gap-CVP_{\beta}$ algorithm takes a basis $b$ for a lattice $\Lambda$ and a vector $\mathbf{v}$ and answers whether or not there exists a lattice vector with a distance between itself and the given vector is at most one, or if every lattice vector has a distance greater than $\beta$ from the given vector.},
    heading={G}
}

@gd{ideal1,
    word={Ideal (Order Theoretic Notion)},
    definition={Given a non-empty subset S of a poset $(P, \leq)$, S is an ideal $I$, if for all $x \in I, y \leq x \Rightarrow y \in I$ (meaning, $I$ is a lower set). For all $x,y \in I$, there exists an element $z \in I$, such that $x \leq z$ and $\y \leq z$, (meaning, $I$ is a directed set).},
    heading={I}
}

@gd{ideal2,
    word={Ideal (general Order Theoretic Notion},
    definition={In general for arbitrary posets defined over lattices, a subset $I \nequal \emptyset$ of a poset $(P, \leq)$ is an ideal if and only if $I$ is a lower set which is closed under finite joins (suprema), and if for all $x,y \in I$ the join $x \vee y$ is also in $I$.},
    heading={I}
}

@gd{lattice,
    word={Lattice (Order Theoretic Notion)},
    definition={In order theory, a lattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which the greatest lower bound (called the join (infimum)) and least upper bound (called the meet (supremum)) both exist and are unique. It follows by completeness over lattices that every finite subset (non-empty) also contains both a join and a meet. },
